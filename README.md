We are using [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) dataset from Kaggle, if you wish to train the model, please download and unzip it, then put ``train`` and ``test`` under ``emotion_detection/data/``

## Demonstration
This AI emotion detection solution not only support real time detection, it also allows end-users input a video for detection. For demonstration, we use a video clip from 94th Academy Awards. With sufficient resolutions, the AI could easily detect happy faces.
